The court lifted the stay it had earlier imposed on proceedings before the Madhya Pradesh High Court, reports Amit Anand Choudhary.

<p class="card-text" style="font-size: small;">
    <strong> Jammu: </strong> Ten Indian Army personnel lost their lives
    and 11 others sustained injuries on Thursday afternoon
    after a military vehicle veered off a hilly road in Jammu
    and Kashmir and fell nearly 200 feet into a deep gorge.
    The incident took place in the upper areas of Doda district
    while the vehicle was en route to an anti-terror operation.
    Officials said the accident occurred near Khanni Top,
    a high-altitude mountain pass on the Bhaderwah–Chamba
    road connecting J&amp;K with Himachal Pradesh.
    Adverse weather conditions and the narrow mountain
    terrain contributed to the mishap. Rescue teams from
    the Army and local police rushed to the spot and
    launched a joint relief operation immediately.
